Retrospective Writeup
===================================================================================================================================

How was work split between teammates?
Work was split up based on each new feature:
Cheat Mode - Austin, Mckenna, Bunty
Easy/Medium/Hard mode - Blake
Leaderboard & timer - Seth
Additional work such as bugfixing and documentation were split up based on whose changes caused bugs or needed to be documented. 

What were the challenges and how were they overcome or dealt with?

Yes, the biggest and most time consuming challenge was figuring out how to make edits to the game and compile them. Nobody in the
group had any experience with actionscript or flash development, so there was a lot of confusion regarding how the files 
interact with each other, what they do, and how to compile them. There was little documentation on these topics. After a lot 
of research, we overcame this problem by discovering Adobe Animate and looking up tutorial projects online. After we had a 
basic understanding of actionscript, the project was fairly straightforward and easy because we could use the code from the 
existing project as an example.

Did any features not make the demo?

All of the features we proposed made the demo and worked as intended. However, some nice features we considered adding included
a play again button, displaying a timer next to the board, and a reset button. We ultimately chose not to add them because we
already had all of our desired features working and didn't want to introduce new bugs.

Is there anything your team could have done differently?

Yes, the early days of the project could have been much more productive, but almost nothing was done because we were so confused
about how to edit and compile actionscript. If we had found a working IDE earlier, we would have been done with the project much
earlier and had more time to polish off the finished product.
