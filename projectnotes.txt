Here is the first file in the Repo; A group of notes from meetings

                                   MEETING: September 3, 2018


Topics: Language to use, Divvy up some work, Set up next meeting time

Notes: Sounds like flash could work well, has a GUI, object oriented, no terminal base.

Classes that we need:

Main
Exec → User Input
Board → create board from user input
Buttons → states: un-clicked box, mine, flag, clicked
Game-play → Controls user functions

Exec:
    -Menu
    -print
Board:
    -Constructor: take size and number of mines
    -Board creator: fills the array with values (0 or 1)
Player:
    -Constructor: takes a board
    -Play: user clicks?

What to do by next meeting:

Get Flash player trial
Get base understanding of flash

    Next meeting time:    Wednesday September 5, 2018
